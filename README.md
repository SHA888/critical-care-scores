# Critical Care Scores — Living Reference

A domain-organized reference of ICU scoring systems, paired with two small tools that keep it honest and current. The reference asserts nothing about a score's 2026 currency unless a citation backs it, and the backing is enforced by CI.

## The loop

```
tools/discover_scores.py  ──finds candidate DOIs──▶  human/triage  ──annotates──▶  SCORES.md
           ▲                                                                             │
           └──────────────── keywords auto-extracted from the doc ◀────────────────────┘
                                                                                        │
 tools/verify_scores.py  ──gates: every non-`unverified` row must cite a resolvable ref──▶ CI (red on breach)
```

**Discovery proposes, the gate disposes.** `discover` only _finds_ and triages candidates; it never sets a status. `verify` only _checks_ that claimed statuses are cited; it never fetches. The Markdown doc is the single source of truth.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `SCORES.md`       | The reference: 24 domains, ~172 rows, `Status` + `Key ref` per row   | 0.2.0   |

Current state: **11 rows verified, 161 `unverified`** (a citation-check-pending flag, _not_ an invalidity claim). `1.0.0` of the reference = `unverified == 0` with all DOIs resolving.

## Quickstart

```sh
# see what we'd search for (no network)
uv run tools/discover_scores.py keywords

# harvest recent candidate DOIs into the living DB
uv run tools/discover_scores.py discover --since 2023 --sources crossref,pubmed --mailto you@example.org
uv run tools/discover_scores.py report --triage candidate

# enforce the contract (CI gate); lower the ceiling as rows get verified
uv run tools/verify_scores.py SCORES.md --max-unverified 161
uv run tools/verify_scores.py SCORES.md --max-unverified 0 --check-dois   # pre-1.0.0
```

Both scripts are stdlib-only (Python ≥3.11; PEP 723 headers, so `uv run` needs no setup). `discover` uses public Crossref + NCBI E-utilities; no API key required (`--ncbi-api-key` only raises rate limits).

## Status taxonomy

`current` · `superseded` · `contested` · `unverified` (default). A row may carry one of the first three **only if** `Key ref` is non-empty; `unverified` rows **must** be ref-empty. The gate is the mechanism that makes this true rather than aspirational.

See [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for the verification protocol, Definition of Done per row, work breakdown by domain, and milestones.

## Verified deltas (2026-06-01)

ARDS Berlin → New Global Definition 2024 (`superseded`); pediatric sepsis → Phoenix 2024 (`current`); adult sepsis SIRS `superseded` / qSOFA `contested` / SOFA `current`; hepatic allocation → MELD 3.0 + PELD-Cr (`current`); AKI RIFLE/AKIN `superseded` → KDIGO `current` (watch: KDIGO 2026 final). Sources R1–R7 in the reference.

## Known rough edges

- `discover` auto-queries are noisy for ~15 rows whose "Full name" is a component mnemonic (AIMS65, 4Ts, APGAR…). Fix: a small curated `OVERRIDES` map before the fallback.
- MCP sources (bioRxiv, Scite, Scholar Gateway, Clinical Trials) are a documented seam (`McpSourceAdapter`), not yet wired — Crossref + PubMed cover DOI discovery out of the box.
- Live HTTP adapters are unit-tested against fixtures, not yet against the real endpoints.

## Caveat

Not medical advice. The reference gives identity and intent of each instrument; exact cutoffs and bedside use must be confirmed against the primary source or a validated calculator.
